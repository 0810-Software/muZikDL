# muZikDL
_Youtube downloader using the Youtube-dl Windows exe._
*Currently in beta*
## NOTE:
MuZikDL is not in a full consumer-ready phase yet (but I am coming up with stuff that might change that soon enough!). It will not (yet) be as nice and polite to you as I would wish it to be.

## Installation of beta versions
Just download the file [MuZikDL_install_script.cmd](https://github.com/0810-Software/muZikDL/raw/master/MuZikDL_install_script.cmd) and run it on a Windows computer (I only tested on Windows 10, but 7 could also still work) with internet. The script won't need admin privileges to run, but **it will ask for them** when installing vcredist_x86.exe. 

If it does not seem to work, please contact me trough [Github Issues](https://github.com/Marnix0810/muZikDL/issues/new) or [The Software 0810 Site's contact form](https://software0810.wordpress.com/contact/).
