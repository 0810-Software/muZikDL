title: download muZikDL beta
---

## Beta installation

Just download the file [MuZikDL_install_script.cmd](https://github.com/Marnix0810/muZikDL/raw/master/MuZikDL_install_script.cmd) and run it on a Windows computer (I only tested on Windows 10, but 7 could also still work) with internet. The script won't need admin privileges to run, but **it will ask for them** when installing vcredist_x86.exe.
