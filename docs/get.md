# Get muZikDL!

### NOTE:

MuZikDL  is not in a full consumer-ready phase yet (but I am coming up with  stuff that might change that soon enough!). It will not (yet) be as nice  and polite to you as I would wish it to be.

## Beta installation

Just download the file [MuZikDL_install_script.cmd](https://github.com/Marnix0810/muZikDL/raw/master/MuZikDL_install_script.cmd) and run it on a Windows computer (I only tested on Windows 10, but 7 could also still work) with internet. The script won't need admin privileges to run, but **it will ask for them** when installing vcredist_x86.exe. 

## Stable installation
Stable releases will be made available trough Github Releases. For now, muZikDL has not had a stable version yet.

You can [sign up for watching](https://github.com/Marnix0810/muZikDL/watchers) to get a mail when the first stable release is rolled out.
